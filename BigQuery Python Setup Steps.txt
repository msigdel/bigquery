****************************
Set up instructions for processing BigQuery using python. 
The instructions were tested on Windows but should work in other systems as well.
****************************

1) Install Python2.7.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Note that we should install Python2.7 version not the Python3.5. Let it install into the default C:\Python27 directory.

2) Install Google Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-windows). 

3) Setup google cloud account and default project with the following command on command prompt. This will open up a page prompting for google account and authorization access.

	C:\>gcloud auth login

4) Setup/Enable default google cloud authentication for your system

    C:\>gcloud auth application-default login

5) Install google-api-python-client.

	C:\Python27\Scripts> easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client

6) Install bigquery-python client.

	C:\Python27\Scripts\easy_install bigquery-python
	

*********************************
Sample program to test the set up
*********************************

Below is sample python program that uses bigquery-python api to get results from a bigquery table. 

#Import required libraries
from bigquery import get_client
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

#Set up API service using default credentials
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
project_id = <<project_id>>
client = get_client(project_id, credentials=credentials)

#Prepare the query string. Replace the <<dataset>> with your dataset
query_str = "select * from <<dataset>>.__TABLES__"

job_id, _results = client.query(query_str)

# Check if the query has finished running.
complete, row_count = client.check_job(job_id)

# Retrieve the results.
results = client.get_query_rows(job_id)

print results
